# Product-Image-Classification-using-CNN

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of various products. The goal of this model is to automatically identify products from images using deep learning techniques. The model has been trained using multiple classes of products and can classify new images with a good degree of accuracy.

Features
CNN Model: The core of the classification model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network, trained to classify product images.
Cross-Validation: The model uses k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance across different subsets of the dataset.
Data Augmentation: Image augmentation techniques are applied to the training dataset to improve model generalization.
Performance Evaluation: The model is evaluated based on accuracy and loss during training and validation.
